# Predictive Analysis for Falcon 9 Landing Success

## Overview

This README outlines the process of predictive analysis for determining the success of the first stage landing of the Falcon 9 rocket. We will build a machine learning pipeline to achieve this prediction. The pipeline includes several key steps:

1. Preprocessing: Standardizing the data to ensure consistency and readiness for machine learning.
2. Train-Test Split: Dividing the dataset into training and testing data to assess model performance.
3. Model Training: Training machine learning models on the data to make predictions.
4. Grid Search: Finding optimal hyperparameters for the models to achieve the best performance.
5. Model Evaluation: Determining the model with the highest accuracy on the training data.
6. Model Testing: Applying the selected model to test data for evaluation.
7. Confusion Matrix: Outputting the confusion matrix to assess model performance.

## Pipeline Steps

### Preprocessing

Preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the data for machine learning. It involves standardizing the data to ensure that it is consistent and suitable for modeling. This step is essential for achieving accurate predictions.

### Train-Test Split

To assess the performance of our machine learning models, we split the dataset into training and testing data. This allows us to train the models on one portion of the data and evaluate their performance on another.

### Model Training

We train multiple machine learning models to make predictions about the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landing. The models considered include:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors

Training these models allows us to assess their predictive capabilities.

### Grid Search

To optimize model performance, we perform a grid search to find the best hyperparameters for each algorithm. This step ensures that the selected algorithm operates at its highest potential.

### Model Evaluation

After training the models and performing the grid search, we evaluate the models' performance on the training data. This assessment helps us determine which model exhibits the best accuracy for our prediction task.

### Model Testing

With the selected model in hand, we apply it to the test data to evaluate its performance in a real-world scenario. This step provides insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

### Confusion Matrix

To assess the model's performance, we output a confusion matrix. This matrix helps us understand the model's ability to correctly classify successful and unsuccessful Falcon 9 first stage landings.

## Future Analysis

The predictive analysis performed in this pipeline offers valuable insights into the likelihood of Falcon 9 first stage landing success. Future analyses may involve refining the model, considering additional features, and exploring more advanced machine learning techniques to improve predictive accuracy.
